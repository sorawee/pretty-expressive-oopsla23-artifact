module PrinterPaper.BernardyCustomizableWidth where

-- This file is an experiment to patch the pretty printer in Bernardy's paper,
-- (BernardyPaper) which does not suffer from combinatorial explosion,
-- to support customizable width limit.
-- Unfortunately, the experiment shows that supporting customizable width limit
-- is precisely what causes the combinatorial explosion,
-- as computations are no longer shared.
-- In our paper, this version is not included.
